# Info
Here are some templates in both English and Swedish for writing laboratory reports in LaTeX. The templates are setup to use a separate preamble file which can be found in the preamble folder and is required to be located in the same folder as the main file to work properly.

### Note
This is a work in progress and will be updated as time goes. No guarantees can be made that this will work for you. It is a personal template and is used for my own reports taking.

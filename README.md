<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This GitHub repository is for my own personal LaTeX templates and is used for storing, managing and creating my templates. It is as up to date as I have energy for and no guarantees can be made that any of these templates may work for you if you try them.

The templates here are setup some in both Swedish and English and some only in Swedish or only in English. So in order to use them you may need to make moderate alterations to the templates to fit your needs and language.

<!-- Usage -->
## Usage

In order to use the templates, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. Some of the templates are setup to use a separate preamble file which can be found in the preamble folder and is required to be located in the same folder as the main file in order for the template to work properly. Other templates are standalone and do not require a separate preamble file.
